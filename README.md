# DKR BCK

*(aka Docker Backup)*

This is a simple backup tool, hosted in a docker container, which tar a folder (attached on Docker run), gzip it, and then send it through FTP

A configuration sample is available in the 'specs' folder

*Note: Created for my own needs. Fork it and complete it if needed*
